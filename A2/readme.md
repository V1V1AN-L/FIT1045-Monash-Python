Using this workspace
=============
1. Make a fork for your team and add your team mates and teacher(s)
2. create the python files listed in the assignment specifications
3. When you are ready to test one of your programs, run the corresponding test file via...
`python test_XXX.py`
4. the results of this will give you a sense of what your program is producing and what was expected (you should assume your teachers will have additional tests so don't hard code the results!)
